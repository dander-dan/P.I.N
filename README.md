# PIN - Power in Numbers

**PIN (Power in Numbers)** is an open-source project aimed at harnessing the collective power of data, collaboration, and computation. The concept behind PIN is simple: by leveraging the strengths of multiple participants, whether it’s in the form of data aggregation, collaborative tools, or decentralized networks, we can create more powerful and efficient solutions to complex problems.

## Project Vision

PIN stands for **Power in Numbers**—a principle that emphasizes the strength and efficiency derived from collective effort. Whether through data analysis, real-time collaboration, or decentralized networks, this project seeks to demonstrate that when individuals or systems come together, they can achieve much more than they could alone.

## Project Goals

- **Collective Computing**: Build solutions where multiple devices/nodes collaborate to perform tasks that are either resource-intensive or require significant data processing.
- **Data Aggregation**: Develop tools to aggregate large datasets, analyze
